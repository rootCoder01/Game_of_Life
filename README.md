John Conway's Game of Life ( C Language)

Description:
This project implements a version of the famous "Game of Life" proposed by mathematician John Conway. The game is a simulation of a cellular automaton that follows simple rules but can generate complex and fascinating patterns.

The main objective of this project is to apply fundamental programming concepts in the C language while developing a functional implementation of the Game of Life. This project was completed as a final project for the Fundamentals of Programming course in the Computer Systems Engineering degree.

Features:
Generating the initial grid with live and dead cells.
Applying Game of Life rules to determine the state of cells in the next generation.
Visualization of the game's evolution at each iteration.
Ability to configure grid size and initial number of live cells.
Additional functionalities to be implemented as future improvements.

Project Status:
Although delivered as a final project, this project is still in the process of development independently. Efforts are being made to enhance its efficiency, add additional functionalities, and optimize the code. The community is encouraged to contribute with suggestions, bug fixes, and improvements.

Important Note:
This project was created for educational purposes and as an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in the Fundamentals of Programming course. While it is expected to be functional, please note that it is still under development and may contain errors. Your understanding and patience are appreciated as we work to improve this project.
